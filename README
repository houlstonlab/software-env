This repo automates management of various environments and containers for
bioinformatics tools. This is intended to be used as central cache of 
images/environments and the recipies to create them.

The directory is structured, as follows

- available-images-environments.txt: list of available images
- singularity-def, docker-files, conda-yaml: contain recipies to create new ones
- resources: contain urls to online registries
- scripts/: contain scripts to pull and build images
- Makefile includes targets
    - Pulling from online registries
    - Building from local recipies
    - Listing images/environments in the cache

To use this repo, run

# Run all targets
make

# Run all target for a specific type of container
make singularity

# Run specific target
make pull-singularity

To add a new container/environment to the cache

- Local recipie: add a Dockerfile, .def or .yaml to the corresponding directory
- Online registry: add a new line to resources/*-urls.txt and rerun it
- nf-core: Download images for nf-core pipelines

list-all target should be exucuted last to update the list of available images 
and environments.

Using this directory as a centeral cache depends on the tool being used. For
example, in the case of Nextflow pipelines, add the path to the relevant cache 
variable

export NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR="/path/to/dir/software-env/conda"
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="/path/to/dir/software-env/singularity"

Or use the full path to the container in each process

process dothat {
    // To use a pre-built conda
    environment "/path/to/dir/software-env/conda/tool"

    // To build and use conda from file
    environment "/path/to/dir/software-env/conda-yaml/too.yaml"

    // To use a local singularity container
    container "file:///path/to/dir/software-env/singularity/tool.sif"
}

NOTES:
- docker would need to be ran on local machines
- nf-core would need to be installed first
- The scripts expect a default directory to be set for the cahces
SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR, DOCKER_CACHEDIR, and CONDA_CACHEDIR otherwise they will be
created as subdirectorie in the current working directory.
